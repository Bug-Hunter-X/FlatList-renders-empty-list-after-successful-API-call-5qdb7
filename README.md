# React Native FlatList Empty List Bug

This repository demonstrates a bug where a FlatList component in React Native renders an empty list even after a successful API call.  The API call is confirmed to be working correctly, and error handling is in place, but the data isn't being rendered. This is likely due to a data-handling issue within the component or an asynchronous problem.

## Bug Description

A successful API call is made, and the response data is available, but the FlatList component remains empty. Loading and error states are correctly handled, but the `data` state in the `FlatList`'s `data` prop never gets populated with the expected data from the API.

## Steps to Reproduce

1. Clone the repository.
2. Run the app (make sure you have the necessary React Native environment set up).
3. Observe that the FlatList remains empty, even though the console logs might indicate successful data fetching from the API.

## Solution

A solution is provided in `bugSolution.js`.  This illustrates a fix for this specific scenario.  The core issue was related to incorrect data handling.  See the file for a complete fix.
